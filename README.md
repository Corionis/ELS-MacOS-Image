# ELS-MacOS-Image

`Note: Due to constraints encountered after completing this ELS will not offer
a macOS DMG install. This project will remain, just in case.`

---

ELS-MacOS-Image contains the files used to build the MacOS .app then DMG for ELS.

Depends on a build from ELS.

Uses appbundler from https://github.com/TheInfiniteKind/appbundler/ to create the "app"
and DMG Canvas ($25) from https://www.araelium.com/dmgcanvas to build the DMG file. 

See [https://github.com/Corionis/ELS](https://github.com/Corionis/ELS).
